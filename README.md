<h2 align=left>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm 21 y/o, studying in a Faster Route, Software Engineering Masters degree at The University of Glasgow. I enjoy anything that lets me express artistic creativity, problem-solving, or sixth sense of groove.</p>

<h4>🎧 | Music Production </h4>

<p>I got into music through the various Vulf Records groups: Vulfpeck at first, then The Fearless Flyers and Vulfmon. After hearing the musical philosophy of the man behind the act - Jack Stratton. I got enlightened by his ideas of minimalism: groove over volume; foot taps over track count. Being a worthy successor to names like, Alphonso 'Fonce' Mizell, Wardell Quezergue, Rick Rubin, etc.. , I try to implement his ideas into my own music, whether being funk, indie rock, or more recently synth/vaporwave. I'm a Logic Pro main, but also interested in learning Ableton Live, and I've used Fruity Loops in the past.</p>

<h4>🎸 | Guitar & Bass Playing</h4>

<p>Contextually, I have a musical degree from the Conservatoire of Covilhã, specialising in the bassoon. Even though it gave me valuable theory and insight for composition, I never truly resonated with the instrument. Eventually, my dad was the primary inspiration for having the courage to change course (He's a Rockstar and I wanna be like him).</p>
<p>I'm self taught, and still a bit of an amateur! I post covers occasionaly (<-- overstatement) to my youtube channel. My goal with guitar & bass is to be technically proficient enough to be able to fluently express my ideas.</p>

<h4>👾 | Indie Games</h4>

<p>What I live for. 112%'d Hollow Knight, completed Silksong, Nine Sols & Katana ZERO. Current wishlist is Celeste (started), Cuphead, and Inscryption (never finished). I view these games and others like them as art, and my biggest purpose is to one day open/join a small studio make my own every day.</p>

<h4>🛠️ | Web/Game Dev</h4>

<p>I love the idea of hosting my own website. Currently, you'll find it's still very barebones (I'd argue vulfpeck.com inspired!), but it's a project I'm building on with time.</p>
<p>Currently learning Unity Engine, and making my own pixel art sprites. Retro/Vaporwave vibes!</p>
